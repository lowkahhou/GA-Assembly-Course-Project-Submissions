       "\"SINGAPORE — Ending months of anticipation, Indonesian ride-hailing firm Gojek made a cautious entry into the Singapore market on Thursday (Nov 29) with the launch of its beta, or prototype, mobile application.\\r\\r\\nIts ride-hailing service will be made available to commuters in batches and will first\\xa0cover more than half of Singapore, including the Central Business District, Jurong East, Changi, Punggol, Ang Mo Kio, and Sentosa. Users have to start and end their journeys within the areas covered.   \\r\\r\\nThese areas were chosen based on population density, and are being limited for now\\xa0to “better manage supply and demand”, the firm said.\\r\\r\\nGojek’s service is expected to be expanded to all Singapore users early next year, and coverage will eventually be islandwide. It will be enlarged progressively through the beta phase, which will last several weeks.  \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nFor now, Go-Jek’s service will cover more than half of the island, including the Central Business District, Jurong East, Changi, Punggol, Ang Mo Kio and Sentosa. Photo: Go-Jek\\r\\r\\n“Thousands” of users will be given access during the beta launch. As part of its partnership with DBS, the Singapore bank’s customers will have priority access on the waitlist, which will be on a first-come, first-served basis.\\r\\r\\nThe beta app can be downloaded from Thursday afternoon on the Apple and Android app stores. Riders will be placed on a waitlist, and will receive an email message or push notification once they have been granted access.\\r\\r\\nDuring registration,\\xa0DBS or POSB customers who are given priority may enter an access code — “DBS” followed by the first six digits of their Visa, Mastercard, or American Express card.\\r\\r\\nThey will be the first users to be allowed to book rides, along with\\xa0an exclusive S$10 voucher credit that they may use on their first two trips (S$5 a\\xa0trip). Commuters who are not DBS customers may download the app during this testing phase, but may take longer to gain access to the service, Gojek said.\\r\\r\\nThere will be no dynamic pricing in the first few weeks. The minimum fare for Gojek rides is S$6. Its base fare is S$2.70, and rate per kilometre travelled is 65 cents. It will not add a per-minute charge as other industry players do.\\r\\r\\nThe company will use feedback from drivers and riders to fine-tune its product.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nSign up for TODAY's newsletter service on any of these platforms. Click here:\\r\\r\\nWhatsApp\\xa0\\xa0Telegram\\xa0Email\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nGojek president Andre Soelistyo said: “Consumers throughout the country have told us that they want more choice in this sector, and with the launch of our beta app, their wait is coming to an end.”\\r\\r\\nAt the Singapore Fintech Festival earlier this month, Mr Soelistyo said that he was a “little bit scared” of its much-anticipated launch here because there was “a lot of demand”. He later clarified with the media that he meant to say he was “excited” about the upcoming event.\\r\\r\\nGojek is muscling into a ride-hailing market dominated by Singapore-based firm Grab. On Oct 29, it made its first move to recruit drivers by launching a portal where they may pre-register to use its platform.\\r\\r\\nThe Jakarta-headquartered company had earlier announced that it was joining hands with DBS in Singapore to offer payment services when its beta app launches here.\\r\\r\\nSingapore is part of the ride-hailing giant’s larger plan for the region.\\r\\r\\nGojek said in May that it would invest US$500 million (S$687 million) in its international expansion strategy to enter markets in the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It also recently raised US$1.5 billion in funding, and its investors include Google, Temasek, Chinese conglomerate Tencent, and Meituan Dianping, a Chinese food-delivery service platform.\\r\\r\\nRIVALS WELCOME COMPETITION\\r\\r\\nGojek’s entry into Singapore is expected to reinvigorate competition in the ride-hailing sector. Grab’s high-profile takeover in March of Uber’s South-east Asia operations — including in Singapore — had\\xa0left commuters and drivers frustrated with the withdrawal of promotional codes and lower incentives.\\r\\r\\nMr Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore, said on Thursday that the firm welcomes competition. “We believe more choice in the market enables innovation and promotes a higher level of service in the industry,” he said. “Grab remains focused on meeting our customers' needs and building on our vision of becoming Singapore’s everyday superapp.”\\r\\r\\nIn September, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore ruled that the Grab-Uber merger\\xa0was anti-competitive, and imposed more than S$13 million in penalties on the two firms.\\r\\r\\nWhile Grab chose not to appeal the decision, Uber decided to do so, saying the competition watchdog’s ruling that the transaction led to a substantial reduction of competition, and that the American firm breached the law intentionally, was “unsupported and incorrect”.\\xa0\\r\\r\\nMr Kay Woo, chief executive officer of MVL — which runs Tada, another ride-hailing app — also said that it welcomes Gojek’s entry.\\r\\r\\n“MVL is committed to bringing better ride-hailing experiences for drivers and riders alike through Tada,” Mr Woo added.\\r\\r\\nPROMOTIONS WON’T BE KEY DIFFERENTIATOR\\r\\r\\nGojek’s focus for now is on providing a point-to-point transport service in Singapore, and consumers hoping for discounts galore are likely to be disappointed.\\r\\r\\nWhile there will be promotions at the start, Mr Soelistyo said that Gojek did not want these and pricing to be the firm’s key differentiator from its rivals.\\r\\r\\n“We want to make sure that the consumer experience is the key differentiation, and also for drivers as well,” he said.\\r\\r\\n“But there are areas we cannot control. For instance, what would our other competitor react with, in terms of giving promotions?”\\r\\r\\nFood and parcel delivery could be introduced here.\\r\\r\\nIn Indonesia, eight in 10 of its food orders are for the smaller merchants or mom-and-pop stores, as opposed to larger chains, said Mr Soelistyo.\\r\\r\\nIts GoSend package delivery service could also work in Singapore, he said. The market has “quite a deep e-commerce penetration with Amazon, Lazada and Shopee, so it naturally will be a value-added service.”\\r\\r\\n\""

Two vessels remained in Singapore’s territorial waters as at 6pm on Thursday, the Maritime Port Authority (MPA) said in response to media queries. Sign up for TODAY’s newsletter service on any of these platforms. Tap here: WhatsAppTelegramEmail Johor's chief minister Osman Sapian on Wednesday visited a Malaysian government vessel named MV Pedoman that was plying the Malaysia-Singapore maritime border. Photos: Singapore Police Force Mr Osmanthen posted on Facebookphotos of himself boarding the vessel and speaking to officers onboard. In his post written in Malay, he thanked the “services and sacrifices” of the officers who were “committed to secure and defend our waters”. The foreign ministers of Singapore and Malaysia met earlier on Tuesday to address their airspace and border disputes. Following the meeting,Malaysia suspended the permanent Restricted Area established over Pasir Gudang in Johor Baru, while Singapore shelved the implementation of the Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) at Seletar Airport for one month. Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and his Malaysian counterpart Saifuddin Abdullah agreed that the transport ministers from both countries should meet soon for discussions on the Restricted Area and the ILS procedures to “ensure the safety and efficiency of civil aviation”. On the maritime dispute over their port limits, the two countries agreed to set up a working group headed by Singapore’s Permanent Secretary (Foreign Affairs) Chee Wee Kiong and Malaysia’s foreign ministry secretary-general Muhammad Shahrul Ikram Yaakob. The group will report to the countries’ foreign ministers within two months. It will also “study and discuss the legal and operational matters in order to de-escalate the situation on the ground, and provide the basis for further discussions and negotiations”, a joint statement said.

       "' 35 and 51, are alleged to be part of a network that bilked hundreds of thousands of dollars from overseas moneylenders and credit-card companies. One of them works in Singapore and the other in the United States.  Two foreign criminals arrested for allegedly being part of Asian and American money laundering network are also expected to be charged, Singapore\\'s police said on Sunday. These three men – who were all native Singaporeans – were arrested by the Singapore police on January 30. The three men, who were also arrested in Malaysia, were the first arrested in a major case involving Chinese nationals from countries like Asia and Africa.  \"We will continue to monitor developments in this case closely, to prevent fraudsters exploiting their connections, using Singapore\\'s resources, and by targeting local people,\" said the police, adding that the case highlights the importance of securing Singaporean authorities\\' cooperation on international crime and cyber protection.  The incident, which occurred at a bank in Singapore, had led Singapore authorities to arrest three more suspects. Singapore\\'s police said they are currently looking at the identity documents of each of the men arrested in Malaysia. The suspects arrested thus far in Malaysia range in age and experience from 28 to 36 years old. There was no information on their links with criminal groups in Asia and Africa. However, the National Police Agency told the daily that one man currently had links with a criminal group in the Philippines.  The police had earlier seized more than 100,000 Singapore dollars at the bank, along with other illicit funds.  Police had warned local and international businesses that if they did not report suspicious activity to their financial and legal systems – such as suspicious transactions, suspicious transactions over $100,000, fake currency, or suspicious transactions over $10,000 – their investment could be jeopardized. The police had warned that any business that allows customers into a closed system and doesn\\'t alert authorities and report suspicious activity will attract additional attention from authorities. The police also urged people who believe they are victims of online scams to contact an emergency hotline on 1800 999 if the matter is still ongoing.  An official of the Department of Finance told The Straits Times that \"Singapore has a strong reputation as a financial destination for people with money\" and that it was an important place for business.<|endoftext|>Pizza Hut is getting on board with the debate about gun control.

       "' it veered toward the South China Sea. It sank on the eastern coast of Singapore soon after it was summoned by police, the MPA added.  According to the MPA, it is unknown exactly how the vessel sank. \"The ship\\'s captain and crew, two crew members and four crew members of other vessels, have been positively identified as missing since February 4, 2016. Singapore police have also requested information from the Maritime Safety Board of Japan (MSBJ) regarding information about the fate of these four people. MSE is yet to receive such information from Japan,\" the MPA read in the following statement. This is the first time a non-Naval vessel has been lost in Singapore\\'s waters since March 2017. It was first registered as Ocean Cooper 1, which was used to ferry relief supplies from the Philippines to the Philippines, at the time the vessel was heading out to sea.  A Coast Guard vessel discovered the ship on Tuesday that was on its way from China to Singapore. An investigation revealed that the crew was taking their own boat to reach the ship to ferry supplies to affected areas and that the engine was running normally. Both MPA and the Coast Guard said that none of the four men had medical insurance. When contacted, a spokesperson for Marine Management in Singapore, which runs the ship, said, \"There\\'s no way for someone to identify the identity of the crew or any crew member without medical insurance. At the end of the day, we\\'ve only got information about the engine (towing) so we can confirm that it\\'s working and we can get someone along to take a closer look.\"  While this case is not unprecedented, it is the second time a ship has lost under such circumstances since April 2016. On July 18, 2016, the MPA dispatched emergency services as a matter of precaution while the ship was heading to Singapore from a Chinese port to handle a rescue-related emergency, it added. Meanwhile, the MPA also confirmed the loss of a vessel which was on a flight from the Chinese port of Tianjin to Japan on June 2, 2016. However, the vessel was carrying a rescue team of 25.

       "\" secret through the school year to avoid parental pressure to confess and punish her, but the teacher discovered the secret when she discovered the girl's behavior towards her father during school activities. The teacher was ordered to report this abuse to the police and she went to the police. She admitted to having performed this sex act on her father on an anonymous anonymous request. The Police was called and detained the teacher, who was made to perform sex acts on her father and she even told the police she had given her consent for sexual conduct by her dad, because she felt this was the only way to help her father through her school's sexual abuse problems and she knew that she had no other option now. During the court proceedings, the teacher tried to claim that she did not do it out of a desire to please her father, but she was refused this because she did not have anything against my dad or him! This shows how ignorant she was and how low her head had sunk! It's sad to see how much this girl has left and how she can't keep secrets with another student and her teacher anymore! She has been subjected to so much emotional abuse and physical violence that it's amazing how she has not come to terms with this, despite knowing her father's history and how serious it is to her in regards to sexual abuse. This incident happened after she and her mother had been separated for a few months, and she had been moved from Primary 6 to Primary 7. The principal at Primary 7 found a picture online of this abuse to be an 'unfair' portrayal of the abuse she has suffered, and she took action and reported this to school authorities. The teacher then went to Principal K (who was also the teacher in Primary 6 and Primary 7 during her school years) to give her a second chance at school and explain the sexual abuse that she has been receiving (this girl's father also knew this and refused to admit anything to anybody). The second attempt failed because she still believed her father was going to keep doing these things regardless. The second attempt was made at school because of her mother and this was very disturbing, but the girls teacher was so afraid of losing her, even more so after her mother was thrown out of the classroom, she was afraid that another parent might come after her to get what they wanted after witnessing that other teacher's actions, which was disgusting and made me feel really bad. After receiving these reports, School administrators made the following decision: We found out that one of her teachers had been charged but due to some bad relationships that had\""
